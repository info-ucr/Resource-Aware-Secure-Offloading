# Resource-Aware-Secure-Offloading

These are the codes for the paper "Resource-Aware Secure Multi-Party Edge Computation Offloading".

First, run "PiNet.py" to get the pre-trained PiNet for the task.

Second, run "Dataset_Prepare.py" to prepare the CiFar10 dataset.

Third, run "Dataset.py" to get the dataset used during $T$ rounds.

Fourthly, run "NMAB.py" to train the neural MAB proposed in the paper.

Finally, run "Baseline.py" for the baselines.
